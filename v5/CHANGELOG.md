# Changelog

## Version 5 (v5)

### Description

This version introduces package organization to improve code structure and maintainability.

### Changes

1. Organized code into packages:
   - `model`: Package for data models (`Item` and `ItemType`).
   - `strategy`: Package for all strategy classes.
2. Updated import statements to reflect the new package structure.
3. Made `GildedRose` class public for better accessibility.

### Item Behavior

- All item behaviors remain the same as in Version 4.

### Version Notes

- The package structure allows for better organization and potential future expansion.
- The `Item` class remains unchanged in functionality but is now in the `model` package.
